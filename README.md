# event-travel-helper

Want to find out how much it costs to book the event that you really wanted to go?
It is as simple as three steps:
* Search for your favorite events
* Pick the event that works best for your schedule
* We will find you the cheapest flight tickets that will get you there and back


###Why
This was the idea I had before participating in the Expedia hackathon 2016.
During the hackathon i ended up joining a group of awesome people on making a travel app called 'Adventure Me',
but I still wanted to try building out my ideas before I lose that itch.

### Library/Tech Used
* React
* Flux (Alt)
* React-Router
* Webpack, Babel
* Expedia API
* Eventbrite API
